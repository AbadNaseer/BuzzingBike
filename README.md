# BuzzingBike
The customer acquisition process at "BuzzingBike" begins with the active identification of potential customers, with the sales staff playing a central role. As soon as a prospective customer visits the store, the sales staff immediately makes contact and conducts an initial conversation to determine the prospect's needs. By asking specific questions about the requirements, preferences and intended use of the bike, the salesperson tries to gain a detailed understanding of the prospect. In addition, the potential customer's available budget is determined in order to be able to assess the existence of a serious interest in purchasing.
However, the lead identification process at "BuzzingBike" is not limited exclusively to physically present customers. The sales staff also proactively engages in the acquisition of prospects acquired through other channels. This includes contacts generated through online marketing campaigns as well as potential customers who have left their contact details at trade shows or other events. The sales staff uses this information to approach the prospects in a targeted manner. Using the CRM system, staff access the stored contact details and the information collected so far and contact the interested parties specifically by phone or email.
After all relevant information has been collected, it is systematically recorded in the CRM system in order to be able to track and maintain contact throughout the further course of the sales process. This dual approach - both looking after customers in the store and proactively acquiring them through alternative channels - ensures that "BuzzingBike" addresses a broad spectrum of potential customers and maximizes the likelihood of converting interested parties into actual buyers. In addition, the lead is divided into a sales group in this step. B2B customers or major customers are taken care of by Michael Neumann as sales manager. Customers who are interested in an e-bike are further looked after by Laura Lenker, as she has completed special training. All other categories are followed up by Karl Kette.
After the successful identification of a potential customer, the process step of lead qualification and final qualified contact follows. This step aims to more precisely assess the potential customer's interest in buying and relevance to the company. The approach of the sales staff varies depending on the type of acquisition. If the customer has already entered the store, the qualification takes place immediately after the initial contact and needs assessment. The sales staff deepens the conversation by asking more specific questions about the customer's preferences and needs. Possible product solutions are discussed to determine whether the products on offer meet the customer's expectations. The sales staff also pays attention to identifying signs of willingness to buy, for example through the customer's interest in product details, a specific price idea or the mention of a planned purchase time. If it turns out that the customer is seriously interested and has the necessary financial means, they are continued as a qualified lead.
For customers who have been identified via online media or through trade fair contacts, lead qualification initially takes place in a different context. After the initial contact by phone or email, the sales staff will try to engage the interested party in a personal conversation, be it by phone, online or ideally in the store. During this conversation, the customer's needs are also asked in more detail, with the aim of evaluating the customer's willingness to buy and understanding whether and how the company can meet their needs. These conversations offer the sales staff the opportunity to deepen interest through targeted questions and find out whether the customer is ready to take the next step in the buying process.
Regardless of which route the customer was acquired through, the goal of lead qualification at "BuzzingBike" is to ensure that only those leads are followed up that have a high potential for an actual sale. This systematic approach increases the efficiency of the sales process and enables the sales staff to focus their resources on promising customers. All information collected is in turn documented in the CRM system to ensure follow-up and a seamless continuation of the sales process.

After the lead has been successfully qualified, the next step in the customer acquisition process is to contact the customer. This step again varies depending on how the customer was acquired.
If the customer has already entered the store and was qualified on site, contact is essentially continued directly. After the sales staff has determined the customer's needs and willingness to buy, the next step is to involve the customer more deeply in the consultation.
For customers who have been identified and qualified via online media or through trade fair contacts, contact is often made in several steps. First, after the initial qualification, the customer is contacted specifically - either by phone or email. The aim of this contact is to initiate a personal conversation, which can take place either by phone, online or by an invitation to the store, depending on the customer's preferences. The customer is invited to discuss further details and - if possible - to make an appointment for a personal consultation in the store, where they can test the products directly. All information and agreements from these contacts are recorded in the CRM system to ensure that the customer profile is complete and up-to-date.
After successful contact, the needs analysis and product presentation step follows. This step is the heart of the sales process, as it creates the basis for the customer's subsequent decision.
When the customer is already in the store, the needs analysis is integrated into the ongoing conversation and then documented in the CRM system. Here, the sales staff deepens the information previously obtained and tries to gain an even more precise understanding of the customer's needs. Questions are asked to find out more precise details, for example what type of bike the customer is looking for (e.g. mountain bike, racing bike, e-bike) and which specific functions or features are particularly important to them. Based on this information, the salesperson then presents targeted products that meet the customer's needs. This includes not only presenting the product features, but also offering test drives and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the various options.
For customers who were acquired via online media or trade fair contacts and who were previously mainly looked after by telephone or email, the needs analysis and product presentation take place in a separate step. After contact has been successfully made and an appointment has been made, the customer is invited to the store to hold the product presentation in a personal setting. If the customer is unable to visit the store, the sales staff can alternatively offer a virtual product presentation in which the products are presented via video conferences or detailed online presentations. A comprehensive needs analysis is also carried out in this phase to ensure that the products presented are optimally tailored to the customer's needs. The needs analysis and product presentation are followed by the submission of an offer. If the customer is in the store after the product presentation and is interested in a specific bike or product combination, the sales staff will prepare an individual offer. This offer is based on the customer's previously determined needs and budget. The sales staff summarizes all the points discussed and formulates a detailed offer that contains all the relevant information, such as the price, any discounts, payment terms and additional services, such as an extended warranty or accessories. The customer receives the offer in written form so that they can look through it at their leisure. In many cases, the offer is made immediately on site to speed up the process and accelerate the purchase.
In the case of a virtual or telephone product presentation, an individual offer is sent by email. In addition to the product information, the offer is supported by visual elements such as images or videos of the products to give the customer a comprehensive impression. All offers are generated and documented in the CRM system so that the sales staff can track the status of each individual offer and take further action if necessary. Synergies can also be generated in this way in order to reserve the desired item with an interface to an inventory management program or ERP system so that no other seller can sell the item at the same time.

Price negotiation and the handling of objections is the next step in the process. When the customer is in the store and has received the offer, the sales staff begins active negotiations. This involves addressing the customer's specific concerns and possible objections. Price negotiations are similar via digital communication channels. The sales staff contact the customer either by phone or email to discuss possible objections and offer solutions. Typical objections can relate to the price, product features or payment terms. The salesperson not only tries to refute the objections, but also offers alternative solutions or additional services. CRM supports this by using previously collected customer data to help them find arguments and further cross-seeking. The salesperson can offer discounts or additional services such as free inspections or accessories to convince the customer. All negotiations and changes to the offer are documented in the CRM system in order to maintain a transparent overview of the entire process and to ensure that all agreements are adhered to.



Here is my Reference-Process/ Sales Funnel in general:

The customer acquisition process begins with the identification of leads or prospects. These can arise, for example, at trade shows, originate from address lists, be customer referrals, or be acquired through research. Both the company and the customer can take the proactive part in this. Subsequently, it is checked whether the lead is a potential buyer, e.g., if they have the necessary financial means or serious interest in a purchase. After lead qualification, the customer is contacted. Depending on the initial situation, the individual phases can also take place simultaneously. Such a situation occurs when the customer visits a sales location. In the case of proactive activities by the company, the qualified lead is usually contacted by the company itself and invited to a sales meeting, in which the needs are analyzed and a suitable product is presented. Consequently, an offer is made, followed by price negotiations, and any possible objections from the customer must be addressed by the salesperson. With a positive response, the sale is concluded, and the prospect is won as a customer.
